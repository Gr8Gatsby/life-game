        <h1>App Suitability</h1>
        <p>
          Life Game is a calm, educational simulator inspired by John Conway’s research into cellular
          automata.

        <h2>Purpose & Audience</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            The experience showcases Conway’s Game of Life: players experiment with grid-based rules
            to see how simple patterns grow and fade. The app is designed for curious learners,
            educators, and fans of computational art who enjoy lighthearted discovery at their own
            pace.

        <div class="card">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Understand how Conway’s four rules create emergent patterns such as gliders, pulsars,
              and Gosper glider guns.
            </li>
            <li>
              Explore mathematical concepts including cellular automata, state transitions, and
              self-organization.
            </li>
            <li>
              Encourage creativity by stamping well-known patterns or designing new Life structures.
            </li>
          </ul>

            <li>No third-party content, advertisements, or external links appear inside the app.</li>
            <li>
              Simulations run locally on the device; the app does not require network access to
              function.
            </li>
            <li>
              Optional diagnostics reporting is controlled by the user and leverages Apple’s privacy
              protections.

          <p>
            Life Game is a single-player experience without real-time or asynchronous communication.
            There is no matchmaking, user-generated content sharing, or multiplayer interaction. All
            creations remain private on the device unless the player shares screenshots manually.

        <h2>Tone & Suitability</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            The app presents a minimalist grid with soft visuals and relaxing pacing, making it
            appropriate for general audiences. There is no violence, adult content, or rapid-action
            gameplay—just an inviting sandbox for experimenting with the patterns that made Conway’s
            work famous.
