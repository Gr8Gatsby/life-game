# Life Simulator

Life Simulator brings Conway's Game of Life to iPhone, iPad, and Mac with a modern interface that makes experimenting with cellular automata effortless. Visit the project homepage at [Life Simulator on GitHub Pages](https://kevin.github.io/life-game/).

## Getting Started
- Launch the app to enter Edit Mode, where you can paint live cells directly onto the infinite grid.
- Use the first-run overlay or the pattern toolbar to drop classic starting shapes like Gliders, Blinkers, or the Gosper Glider Gun.
- Press Play to watch the universe evolve generation by generation; pause or Step to advance manually at any time.

## Core Features
- **Infinite canvas** that supports panning and smooth pinch-to-zoom so you always have room to build.
- **Smart auto-zoom** keeps every live cell visible with a gentle buffer, zooming in or out as populations grow or shrink.
- **Auto-stop** halts playback automatically when the simulation stabilizes or life dies out.
- **Analytics header** tracks current population, historical highs and lows, and renders a sparkline of recent generations.
- **Undo/redo history** (50 steps) for every stamp, toggle, or clear action while in Edit Mode.

## Edit Mode Essentials
- Toggle Edit Mode from the control bar; it turns on automatically when the app opens.
- Choose from the left-aligned toolbar of patterns to stamp ready-made structures, or tap/click individual cells to design your own.
- Previewed patterns follow your cursor until you confirm placement; hit `Esc` to cancel.
- Starting playback hides the toolbar and locks edits until you return to Edit Mode.

## Playback & Controls
- Media-style controls make it easy to play, pause, reset, or advance one generation at a time.
- Zoom controls sit in the bottom bar for quick adjustments; zoom aggregation keeps distant patterns legible.
- When auto-zoom is enabled, the view adjusts only when needed to keep the active population in frame.

## Customize Your Experience
- Open Settings from the control bar to tailor the simulator to your preferences.
- Adjust generation speed on the fly with the speed slider or presets.
- Toggle auto-zoom and auto-stop, and choose a zoom mode (Fit or Out) that matches your viewing style.
- Personalize the grid with color pickers for live cells, background, grid lines, and center axes.
- Save custom themes and revert anytime with Reset to Defaults.
